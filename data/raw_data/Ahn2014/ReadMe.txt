Raw choice data of the healthy control (N=48), amphetamine (N=38) and heroin (N=43) groups on the modified Iowa Gambling Task (Bechara et al., 2001), published in Ahn et al. (2014) Frontiers in Psychology (Decision Neuroscience). There are 4 columns:trial --> trial numberdeck --> chosen deck on each trial. 1,2,3,4 --> deck A,B,C,Dgain --> gain on each trialloss --> loss on each trialsubjID --> subject IDThe R codes for performing hierarchical Bayesian analysis of the Prospect Valence Learning (Ahn et al., 2008; 2011) or Value-Plus-Perseverance (Worthy et al., 2013) models, and computing Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) are available by request to the first author (Woo-Young Ahn; wooyoung.ahn@gmail.com).
