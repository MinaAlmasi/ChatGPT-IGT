In this card game, choose cards from four decks (A, B, C, D) to earn money. 
Wins increase your 'TOTAL EARNINGS,' while losses decrease it. 
You can switch decks anytime, but you may also stay at a deck. 
Aim to maximize earnings, minimize losses, and avoid the worst decks. The game ends unpredictably. Start with a $2000 credit and remember, some decks are better than others. Choose a deck (A, B, C, D) for each turn.
